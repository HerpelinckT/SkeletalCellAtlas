# The Skeletal Cell Atlas

Breakthroughs in improving scalability have led to the creation of organism-wide transcriptomic datasets, aiming to comprehensively profile the cell types and states within an organism throughout its lifecycle. To date however, the skeleton remains a majorly underrepresented organ system in organism-wide atlases. Considering that the skeleton is the central framework of the vertebrate body, the home of the hematopoietic niche and a central player in major metabolic and homeostatic processes, this presents a major deficit in current reference atlas projects. To address this issue, we integrated nine separate scRNA-seq datasets containing skeletal cells and their developmental precursors, generating an atlas of nearly one million cells. This skeletal cell atlas describes cells across the mesenchymal lineage from the induction of the limb field to adult bone, encompassing over 50 different cell states.

This repository contains all notebooks required to perform the analyses performed in the manuscript and generate all figures.
